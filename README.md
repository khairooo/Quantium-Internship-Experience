# Quantium-Internship-Experience


Task and main steps:
- Analyze transaction and customer data to identify trends and inconsistencies. 
- Develop metrics and examine sales drivers to gain insights into overall sales performance. 
- Create visualizations and prepare findings to formulate a clear recommendation for the client's strategy.

## Task 01 
### Here is the background information on my task 01 
- As a part of Quantium’s retail analytics team and have been approached by my client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.

The insights from my analysis will feed into the supermarket’s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

- I have received the following email from the manager, Zilinka.(Virtual and Standard Email)

- 'Hi, 

- Welcome again to the team, we love having new graduates join us! 

- I just wanted to send a quick follow up from our conversation earlier with a few pointers around the key areas of this task to make sure we set you up for success. 

- Below I have outlined your main tasks along with what we should be looking for in the data for each. 

- Examine transaction data – look for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. If you determine any anomalies make the necessary changes in the dataset and save it. Having clean data will help when it comes to your analysis. 

- Examine customer data – check for similar issues in the customer data, look for nulls and when you are happy merge the transaction and customer data together so it’s ready for the analysis ensuring you save your files along the way.

- Data analysis and customer segments – in your analysis make sure you define the metrics – look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights you find. These will all form part of our report to Julia. 

- Deep dive into customer segments – define your recommendation from your insights, determine which segments we should be targeting, if packet sizes are relative and form an overall conclusion based on your analysis. 

- Make sure you save your analysis in the CSV files and your visualisations – we will need them for our report. If you could work on this analysis and send me your initial findings by end of next week that would be great.  

- Looking forward to reviewing your work.

  ## Task 02
  ### Here is the baground information on my task 02
  - The Category Manager for Chips, has asked us to test the impact of the new trial layouts with a data driven recommendation to whether or not the trial layout should be rolled out to all their stores.

I-  have received the following email from Zilinka.

- Hi, 

- Thanks for your feedback earlier, I’m glad you find my follow up emails helpful in ensuring your on the right track.

- For this part of the project we will be examining the performance in trial vs control stores to provide a recommendation for each location based on our insight. Below are some of the areas I want you to focus on, of course if you discover any other interesting insights feel free to include them in your findings.

- Select control stores – explore the data and define metrics for your control store selection – think about what would make them a control store. Look at the drivers and make sure you visualise these in a graph to better determine if they are suited. For this piece it may even be worth creating a function to help you. 

- Assessment of the trial – this one should give you some interesting insights into each of the stores, check each trial store individually in comparison with the control store to get a clear view of its overall performance. We want to know if the trial stores were successful or not. 

- Collate findings – summarise your findings for each store and provide an recommendation that we can share with Julia outlining the impact on sales during the trial period.

- Remember when working with a client visualisations are key to helping them understand the data. Be sure to save all your visualisations so we can use them later in our report. We are presenting to our client in 3 weeks so if you could submit your analysis by mid next week that will give us great amount of time to discuss findings and pull together the report.

- Keep up the good work!

- Thanks, 

- Zilinka'




Thanks,
